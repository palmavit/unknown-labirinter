# Robocake

![Robocake models](1.png)

Programming Robocake robots using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) in a
[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulated environment.

## Prerequisites

The project was developed primarily using ROS Kinetic (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS), but
should work with ROS Melodic (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) and possibly other operating
systems.

Requirements:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- ROS Kinetic Kame full desktop installation
  ([instructions](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu))
- Gazebo 7
  ([instructions](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install))
- Additional dependencies:

  `sudo apt install ros-kinetic-ros-control ros-kinetic-ros-controllers
  ros-kinetic-gazebo-ros-control`

## Setup

For general tutorials on getting started with ROS, see
[ROS wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials). Tutorials for specific steps will
be linked where appropriate.

1. Create a catkin workspace. [Catkin](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin) is a tool
   used for building ROS packages. See
   [instructions](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).

   `mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src`

   `cd ~/catkin_ws`

   `catkin_make`

2. Activate the workspace.

   `source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash`

   If you are using `zsh`, source the `setup.zsh` file instead.

   Note that this needs to be done every time you want to run the project from a
   newly opened shell. To make this automatic, run the following command:

   `echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`

   Or the equivalent for `.zshrc` if you are using `zsh`.

3. Clone this repository into `~/catkin_ws/src`

   `cd ~/catkin_ws/src`

   `git clone <address>`

4. Build the project. See
   [catkin tutorial](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/using_a_workspace)
   for more information.

   `cd ~/catkin_ws`

   `catkin_make`

5. To test if everything is set up correctly, run the demo simulation.

   `roslaunch robocake_gazebo demo.launch`

   This should open a Gazebo window showing two robots chasing each other around.

   See [wiki page](https://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) for more information on using
   `roslaunch`.

## Overview

The project contains four packages. Here is a high level overview of them.

### robocake\_description

Contains descriptions of the two Robocake robots in xml-based
[urdf](https://wiki.ros.org/urdf) format.

The `urdf` folder contains definitions of each moving part or sensor that a
robot is build from. The `robots` folder contains files that assemble these
parts into a whole robot.

The `meshes` folder contains 3d models of each of these parts. For some of the
more complex ones there are simplified versions of them for collision detection.

The package includes a launch file for opening a robot model in
[rviz](https://wiki.ros.org/rviz). It displays the robot's model and can also be
used vor visualizing things like odometry or sensor readings.

The `model` argument is used to determine which robot to display.

`roslaunch robocake_description rviz.launch model:=green`

or

`roslaunch robocake_description rviz.launch model:=orange`

### robocake\_gazebo

Contains configuration for simulating the robots in Gazebo.

The following launch files are included:

- `demo.launch` - a demo simulation with two robots.

- `gazebo.launch` creates an empty simulated world. After running this one,
  multiple robots can be spawned from separate shells.

  `roslaunch robocake_gazebo gazebo.launch`

  The texture of the floor can be changed by replacing or editing
  `models/floor.png`. The description of the world is located in
  `worlds/room.world`. See
  [specification](http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.6&elem=world) of the file
  format.

- `spawn.launch` spawns a new robot into the world. This accepts a number of
  parameters:

  - `model` - either `green` or `orange`. The only required argument.

  - `algorithm` - whether to run a default movement algorithm associated with a
    robot. See `robocake_algorithm`. Defaults to false.

  - `robot_name` - used to differentiate between multiple robots. By default a
    long unique name is generated. This can be used to assign a shorter, more
    readable name.

  - `x`, `y` `theta` - initial coordinates and orientation (angle in radians).

  Example usage:

  `roslaunch robocake_gazebo spawn.launch model:=green robot_name:=robocake x:=1 y:=0.5`

### robocake\_controllers

Configures a differential drive controller for use with two-wheeled Robocake
robots. See [wiki page](https://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller) for list of
parameters.

The controller converts linear and angular velocity commands into wheel
movements. It accepts input on the `cmd_vel` topic. See the
[tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingTopics) on
understanding ROS topics.

To control a robot directly, `rqt_robot_steering` can be used.

`rosrun rqt_robot_steering rqt_robot_steering`

This opens a window with robot controls.

![rqt\_robot\_steering](4.png)

The topic of the associated robot needs to be put into the input field. It has
the form `/<robot_name>/diff_drive_controller/cmd_vel`. `<robot_name>` is either
generated automatically or is passed as a parameter to `spawn.launch`. Use
`rostopic list` from a terminal to list all topics and find the needed one.

For an example of controlling a robot programmatically, see the C++ code in
`robocake_algorithm`.

### robocake\_algorithm

This package contains two ROS executables ([nodes](https://wiki.ros.org/Nodes))
that give certain behavior to the robots. For more information on creating and
running nodes, see tutorials for
[C++](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber(c%2B%2B) and
[Python](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber(python).

The behavior associated with the green robot is defined in `random.cpp`.
The algorithm drives the robot around the white area on the floor, turning in a
random direction once it reaches the edge of the dark area.

The algorithm for the orange robot is defined in `follow.cpp` and makes it
follow another robot at a certain distance, while trying to avoid collisions.

To spawn a robot with an algorithm running, use the `algorithm:=true` argument.

`roslaunch robocake_gazebo spawn.launch model:=green algorithm:=true`

To create nodes for other algorithms, see the tutorials linked above. For C++,
the rough steps are the following:

- Write a `.cpp` file with a main function as shown in the tutorial.

- Add corresponding entries to `CMakeLists.txt` (`add_executable`,
`target_link_libraries` and optionally `set_target_properties`).

- Build the package by running `catkin_make` from the workspace root
(`~/catkin_ws`).

- Run the node using `rosrun robocake_algorithm <node_name>` or by editing one
of the launch files to run it automatically.
